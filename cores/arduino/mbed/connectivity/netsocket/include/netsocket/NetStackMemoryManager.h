/**
 * Network Stack interface memory manager
 *
 * This interface provides abstraction for memory modules used in different IP stacks (often to accommodate zero
 * copy). NetStack interface is required to accept output packets and provide received data using this stack-
 * independent API. This header should be implemented for each IP stack, so that we keep EMAC module independent.
 *
 * NetStack memory interface uses memory buffer chains to store data. Data passed in either direction
 * may be either contiguous (a single-buffer chain), or may consist of multiple buffers.
 * Chaining of the buffers is made using singly-linked list. The NetStack data-passing APIs do not specify
 * alignment or structure of the chain in either direction.
 *
 * Memory buffers can be allocated either from heap or from memory pools. Heap buffers are always contiguous.
 * Memory pool buffers may be either contiguous or chained depending on allocation size.
 *
 * On NetStack interface buffer chain ownership is transferred. EMAC must free buffer chain that it is given for
 * link output and the stack must free the buffer chain that it is given for link input.
 *
